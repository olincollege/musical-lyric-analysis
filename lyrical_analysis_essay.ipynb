        "### Introduction\n",
        "While countless elements are required to make a great musical - a compelling story, likeable (or dislikeable) characters, and the way the set and the actors come together, the music and lyrics are what seperates the good from the bad when it comes to musicals - music is in the name, after all. But what exactly is it about shows' music and lyrics that sets them apart from the others? While some shows and composers are all about a catchy beat, others are known for thier wordcraft and vocabulary, and this project aims to explore this latter and it's influence on a show's performance. In this project, we set out to analyze and determine whether the uniqueness & complexity of a musical's lyrics had an influence on the show's attendance on Broadway, a district in New York City that is the home of theater in the United States.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology\n",
        "Before we get into the nitty-gritty of data sources and hundreds of lyrics, what exactly \"lyrical uniquness\" is must be definied. For this project, a song's lyrical uniqueness is defined as the percentage of unique words that make up the lyrics (number of unique words in the song divided by total words in the song). For each musical, an average is taken of each song's uniqueness to determine the musical's overall uniqueness\n",

However, of our interest, the CORGIS project has [a dataset](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/broadway/) consisting of various data about shows on Broadway. This dataset, including data from the mid 1990s up until 2016, contains every show that was on Broadway, it's attendance, the number of shows performed, and various other data on a week-by-week basis.

[The LyricsGenius Library](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/) was used to access information stored on the website easily inside of Python.

Next, all performances before the year 1995 were filtered out since the data seemed to be full of gaps. After this, all other irrelevant columns of data were dropped including the show's date (day, month, and year), the name of the theater it was performed at, the capacity, the potential gross profit, and the gross profit. The refined data was then written to a CSV file in the project directory."

        "Finding the correct album on Genius to use is not as simple as it may seem. If just the show's title is inputted things could go wrong in many different ways. For example, if just \"Sweeney Todd\" is inputted, the movie soundtrack may come up, which has cut many of the songs and has cut all sung ensemble lines so it would translate better to a film. This makes the movie's lyrics vastly shorter than the Broadway musical's. If just \"Cry Baby\" is inputted, then the Melanie Martinez album may appear by mistake due to its popularity in comparison to the musical of the same name. Some musicals have more common or ambiguous words making up their titles such as \"Assassins,\" making it difficult to use only the title as the search term. To counteract this issue, an album was only \"found\" for a musical if the keyworkd \"broadway\", \"cast\", *or* \"recording\" were found to be included with the title. When searching for an album on Genius, it returns the first 5 results that match the search terms, and we are choosing the first one to include one of these keywords."

Each album and song found on Genius has a unique Album ID and Song ID respectively. Using this Album ID, all of the proper song IDs for each musical were collected, allowing for the program to access an entire album's lyrics. A CSV file, titled by Album ID, was created for each musical; in it each row corresponded to a different song and each column was populated by an individual lyric in that song. This scheme of saving lyrics to individual CSV files was chosen since downloading lyrics is a very time-intensive process (taking upwards of a minute per musical), so this allowed us to download lyrics a single time and quickly retireve them later. This also allows us to avoid issues with the Genius API rate limiting the program."

Despite their importance, they alone do not contribute to a musical's success. Based on the results of graphing various measures of a Broadway musical's success in comparison to either it's lyrical uniqueness or total lyric count, it is safe to conclude that a musical's lyrical amount or uniqueness has little to no impact on it's success. \n",
        "\n",
        "If given more time, a musical's lyrical repetitiveness (how many times certian words or phrases are repeated) in comparison to measures of its success is something that could be analyzed. It could then be concluded whether or not having certian words or phrases repeated continuously would cause the viewer to become bored or annoyed and contribute to future lower attendance numbers or a shorter stay on Broadway.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another thing that would be interesting to test would be a musical's lyrical uniqueness in comparison to every show's lyrics. Looking at what shows use words that no other show uses and whether or not that aspect makes them stand out, become pupular, and stay relevant, would be very fun. \n",
        "\n",
        "Good lyrics may be essential to creating a successful musical, but the importance of having complex characters, talented actors, catchy melodies, and a memorable story outweigh that.\n"
